# JayCodeTemplates
This is my personal template repository for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects. It serves as a structured foundation for building modern, responsive, and creative web pages or applications.

The goal of this collection is to make web development faster and more efficient by providing ready-to-use code snippets, layouts, animations, and component examples — all written in clean, maintainable code.

While this project is open-source, it is protected by permission — meaning anyone interested in using, modifying, or redistributing the templates must first obtain my consent. This helps maintain the integrity of the work while still promoting learning and collaboration within the developer community.

In short, this repository is both a learning tool and a launchpad for anyone who wants to build stunning, functional websites using standard web technologies.
